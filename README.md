# 🏦 Bank Account Manager with Excel (Python)

This is a simple **bank account management system** built in Python using the `openpyxl` library. It allows users to manage basic banking operations such as:

- Searching for accounts by **name** or **account number**
- **Depositing** money into an account
- **Withdrawing** money (with balance checks)
- **Viewing** account information and current balance

The account data is stored and managed using an Excel file (`bank_accounts.xlsx`), making it easy to view or edit outside the script.
